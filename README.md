# The Book Nook: A Backend Sanctuary

Welcome to **The Book Nook**, a powerful backend API designed to manage a thriving online bookstore. This API is built using **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, providing a secure and scalable foundation for any book-selling venture.

### üåê Explore the Nook

- **Live Site**: [Step into the Nook](https://book-shop-server-3trk.vercel.app) (If deployed)

## üìñ Unveiling the Treasures Within (Key Features)

- **Curated Collection Management (Admin Realm)**: Admins can add, update, and delete books, managing the entire catalog with ease.
- **Tailored Access (Roles)**:
  - **The Grand Librarian (Admin)**: Full control over the library, transactions, and orders.
  - **The Avid Reader (User)**: Browse the catalog, purchase books, and track order history.
- **Secure Entry (Authentication & Authorization)**: Secure user authentication using JWT and role-based access control.
- **Finding Your Next Read (Advanced Search, Sorting, and Filtering)**: Powerful filters and search capabilities help users easily find their favorite books.
- **Seamless Orders (Transactions & Order Management)**: Users can place orders, while admins can manage the entire transaction process.
- **Payment Integration (Optional)**: Secure payment processing using platforms like Stripe or PayPal (optional).
- **Scalability and Performance**: The API is built for optimal performance and scalability to handle a growing catalog and user base.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Own Nook (Installation)

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Book-Shop-Server.git
   cd Book-Shop-Server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual values. **Never** commit `.env` to version control.

4. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev  # For development
   npm run start      # For production
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Nook's Foundation (Technologies)

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt.js for hashing passwords
- **Environment Management**: dotenv for environment variables
- **Other Tools**: CORS, express-validator, body-parser

## üöÄ Deployment

- **Deployment Platforms**: Vercel, Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, or any other server hosting service.
- **CI/CD Setup**: Automate deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or any other CI tool of your choice.

## Key Elements and Structure Guidance

### **Project Initialization:**

1. **Create `package.json`** using:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose typescript dotenv cors bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
   ```

3. **Set Up `tsconfig.json`** for TypeScript configuration.

### **Express App Setup:**

1. Create the main application file (`app.ts` or `server.ts`) to initialize your Express app and set up the connection to MongoDB.

2. Implement necessary middleware such as CORS and JSON body parsing.

### **Routes & Controllers:**

1. Define routes for each resource, e.g., books, users, and orders.

2. Implement the business logic in the corresponding controllers (`book.controller.ts`, `user.controller.ts`).

### **Models (Schemas):**

1. Define Mongoose models for your data, such as `book.model.ts` for books and `user.model.ts` for users.

### **Authentication & Authorization:**

1. **JWT**: Use JWT tokens for authentication, and protect certain routes with middleware.
2. **Role-Based Authorization**: Implement checks based on user roles (Admin vs. User).

### **Error Handling:**

1. Implement global error handling middleware to catch and return errors properly.

### **Testing:**

1. Write unit and integration tests to ensure the API functions correctly (e.g., using Jest).

### **Deployment:**

1. Deploy your app using platforms like **Vercel**, **Heroku**, or **AWS**.
